# Installation
```
npm install termfx
```

# Usage
## LF Files (Line feed)
These type of files **do not** have a carriage return character at the end of each line(`\r`) and require this, otherwise everything printed out would be displayed in 1 line.
```js
const termfx = require('termfx');
var registry = new termfx.New(null, true);

registry.RegisterVariable("foo", "bar");
registry.RegisterFunction("sleep",
  function(delayInms){
    return new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, delayInms));
  }
);

var string =
`<<sleep(1000)>>
that was 1 second
<<sleep(5000)>>
that was 5 seconds
<<$foo>>`;

registry.Execute(string, process.stdout.write.bind(process.stdout));
```
## CRLF Files(Carriage return line feed)
This is what most files termfx is supposedly parsing, files are expected to have `\r\n` at the end of each line. This mode will not add a carriage return `\r` at the end of each line.
```js
const termfx = require('termfx');
var registry = new termfx.New();

registry.RegisterVariable("foo", "bar");
registry.RegisterFunction("sleep",
  function(delayInms){
    return new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, delayInms));
  }
);

var string =
`<<sleep(1000)>>
that was 1 second
<<sleep(5000)>>
that was 5 seconds
<<$foo>>`;

registry.Execute(string, process.stdout.write.bind(process.stdout));
```
## Custom splitter
Using a custom splitter that isn't the default `<<`, `>>`.
```js
// custom splitter
const termfx = require('termfx');
var registry = new termfx.New(["[[", "]]"], true);
```
